# CSE471_Project1
To contribute -->

1. Clone this project, this is the Synthie project standard (provided for us)
2. Ideally, we would make branches and pull requests and things to make sure we're not stepping in eachothers toes like Owen outlines here

> https://facweb.cse.msu.edu/cbowen/cse335/git/

3. Make changes (small features that compile) and commit them often!
4. Push your changes.
5. Once they look good, we'll merge everything into the master branch
